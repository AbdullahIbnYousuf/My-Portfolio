# My Portfolio Website

## Description
This is a personal portfolio website built to showcase my skills, projects, and experiences as a web developer. It features a modern, responsive design with smooth animations and navigation. The site was developed following a YouTube tutorial on React web development, incorporating best practices for front-end building.

## Features
- **Responsive Design**: Fully mobile-friendly layout that adapts to different screen sizes.
- **Smooth Navigation**: Single-page application (SPA) routing for seamless page transitions without full reloads.
- **Animations**: Subtle animations on elements like fades, slides, and interactions for a dynamic user experience.
- **Custom Styling**: Utility-first CSS with custom color themes for a unique look.
- **Icons and Images**: Integrated icons and optimized images (e.g., AVIF format) for better performance.
- **Sections**: Home, About, Projects, Contact, and more (customize as needed).
